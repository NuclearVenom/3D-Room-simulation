# 3D Room simulation
I was experimenting with 3D graphics and simulation and these are some results.
I have used basic HTML5 framework with Three.js in the html files, where as, pygames with OpenGL/moderngl was used in the python programs.
Feel free to experiment and use the code with a pull request and i would like to see what creativity you can show with your skills. 
Each program contains the instruction on how to interact with the simulation.
AI models like chatgpt, claude.ai and deepseek helped me a lot in leaning and creating my imagination into reality.
